'''
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

    def findComplement(self, num):
        i = 1
        while num >= i:
            num ^= i

#Find the bit length (say L) and flip num by num ^ 11...1 (L ones).
    def findComplement(self, num):
        return num ^ ((1<<num.bit_length())-1)
#Again find the bit length first.
    def findComplement(self, num):
        return num ^ ((1 << len(bin(num)) - 2) - 1)
    def findComplement(self, num):
        return num ^ ((2<<int(math.log(num, 2)))-1)
#We can also flip num first (including the leading zeros) using ~num and then get the last L bits by & 11...1 (L ones).

#For example,

    def findComplement(self, num):
        return ~num & ((1<<num.bit_length())-1)
