# Notes for bit operation
Bit operation is the same fast as +, -.
but bit operation is faster than multiplication/division.

bit operation:
<<
>>
&
|
~

examples:
3&5     & Binary AND
the binary representation of 3 is 011
the binary representation of 5 is 101
the binary representation of 3&5 is 1
so 3&5 is 1.

tricks of &. X&0 for any numebr X. The last digit of binary representation is always 0.


4|7     | Binary OR
the binary representation of 4 is 100
the binary representation of 7 is 111
the binary representation of 4|7 is 111
so 4|7 is 7.

tricks of |. X|1 for any numebr X. The last digit of binary representation is always 1.

2^5     ^ Binary XOR
the binary representation of 2 is 10
the binary representation of 5 is 101
the binary representation of 2^5 is 111
so 2^5 is 7.

~3      ~ Binary Ones Complement
~3 = -(11+1) in binary = -(100) in binary = -4


3<<2    << Binary Left Shift
3 = 11<<2 = 1100 =12

3>>2    >> Binary Right Shift
3>>2 = 11>>2 = 0
10>>1 = 1010>>1 = 101 =5
