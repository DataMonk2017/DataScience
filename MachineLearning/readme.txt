Machine Learning Model is a folder contaions all ML algorithms I have done/implemented.
I am keeping adding new alogrithms in this folder.

machine-learning-ex1: the implementation of Linear Regression in Matlab/Octave.

machine-learning-ex2: the implementation of Logistic Regression with regularization and Linear Regression with regularization in Matlab/Octave.

machine-learning-ex3: the implementation of Nerual Networks in Matlab/Octave.

machine-learning-ex4: the implementation of Nerual Networks in Matlab/Octave.

machine-learning-ex5: Apply some dirty tricks in Machine learning in Matlab/Octave.

Decision Tree: Decision Tree in R

Text Mining in R: Text Mining in R

expectation maximization: expectaion maximization in Python
